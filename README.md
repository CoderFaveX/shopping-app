# Simple Shopping App

Welcome to the Simple Shopping App project! This mobile application demonstrates a basic shopping experience using React Native. It was really fun to create.

## Features

- **Products Screen:** Displays a list of products available in the shop.
- **Checkout Screen:** Allows users to add/remove products to/from the checkout list.
- **Navigation:** I put in a bottom navigation bar for easy switching between screens.
- **Order Success:** Upon placing an order, users are navigated to a success screen.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native:** Frontend framework for building native mobile applications.
- **JavaScript/ES6+:** Language used for development.
